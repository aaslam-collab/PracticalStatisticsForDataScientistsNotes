# Statistical Experiments and Significance Testing

## Inference Pipeline
1. Formulate hypothesis
2. Design experiment
3. Collect data
4. Inference/Conclusions

## A/B Testing
- Experiment with 2 groups to establish which of 2 treatments/product/procedure is better.

### Key terms:
- Treatment: Something to which a subject is exposed. (Drug, price, web headline).
- Treatment group: Group of subjects exposed to a specific treatment.
- Control group: Group of subjects exposed to no (or standard) treatment.
- Randomization: Process of randomly assigning subjects to treatments.
- Subjects: Items exposed to treatment (web visitors, patients, etc).
- Test statistic: metric used to measure the effect of the treatment.
  
## Why have a control group?
- Without a control group, there is no assurance that "all other things are equal" and that any difference is really due to the treatment (or to chance). When you have a control group, it is subject to the same conditions (except for the treatmen of interest) as the treatment group.

## Hypothesis Tests/Significance tests
- Purpose of these tests is to help you learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect.

### Key terms:
- Null hypothesis: The hypothesis that chance is to blame.
- Alternative hypothesis: Counterpoint to the null (what you hope to prove).
- One-way test: Hypothesis test that counts chance results only in one direction.
- Two-way test: Hypothesis test that counts chance results in two directions.

##
- An A/B test is typically constructed with a hypothesis in mind. E.g. hypothesis could be that price B produces higher profit.
- Statistical hypothesis testing was invented as a way to protect resarchers from being fooled by random chance.
- We perform statistical hypothesis testing for further analysis on A/B test, or any randomized experiment, to assess whether random chance is a reasonable explanation for the observed difference between groups A and B.
