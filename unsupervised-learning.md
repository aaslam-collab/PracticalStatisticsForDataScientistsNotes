# Unsupervised Learning

- Statistical methods that extract meanning from data without training a model on labeled data. 
- Unsupervised learning can be used to create predictive rule in absence of a labled respone. The goal may be to reduce the dimension of the data to a more manageable set of variables. This reduced set can then be used as an input into a predictve model, such as regression or classification. unsupervided learning can also be viewed as an extension of the exploratary data analysis. The aim is to gain insight into a set of data and how the different variables relate to each other.
-  Unsupervised techniques allow you to sift through and analyze these variables and discover relationships.
